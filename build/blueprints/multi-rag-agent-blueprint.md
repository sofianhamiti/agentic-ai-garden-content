# Multi-RAG Agent Blueprint

This blueprint provides a detailed architecture for implementing an AI agent that can dynamically select and utilize multiple specialized RAG pipelines based on query context.

## Architecture Overview

The Multi-RAG Agent architecture consists of:

- Query router for determining appropriate knowledge domains
- Specialized RAG pipelines for different data types and sources
- Result synthesizer for merging information from multiple pipelines
- Context manager for maintaining conversation state

## Implementation Components

### Query Router

The query router analyzes incoming queries and determines which specialized RAG pipelines should be engaged. Routing decisions are based on:

- Named entity recognition
- Topic classification
- Explicit user instructions
- Conversation context

### Specialized RAG Pipelines

Multiple RAG pipelines, each optimized for different data sources or domains:

- Structured data RAG (databases, tables)
- Unstructured document RAG (PDF, documents)
- Code RAG (repositories, documentation)
- Image-aware RAG (diagrams, charts)

### Result Synthesizer

A component that merges and reconciles information from multiple RAG pipelines to provide a coherent response, with:

- Information prioritization
- Conflict resolution
- Citation tracking
- Confidence scoring

## AWS Implementation

This blueprint leverages:
- Amazon Bedrock for foundational models
- Amazon OpenSearch for vector storage
- AWS Lambda for serverless processing
- Amazon S3 for document storage
